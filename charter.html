<h2>Three Roles for Civic Witness</h2>

<p><em>Ideally, you need three people.</em></p>

<h3>Audio Integrity</h3>
<p>
When recording is underway, care should be taken to preserve the clarity of spoken audio.
Loud signals (such as whistles or shouted alerts), if used, should be deployed outside the immediate
recording area whenever possible, so that speech, names, commands, and contextual sounds remain
intelligible for later review or potential evidentiary use.
</p>

<h3>One: the Witness</h3>
<p>
The witness gets as close as possible—safely—to record exactly what is going on.
Exactly as it is. No commentary.
</p>

<h3>Two: the Archivist or Journalist</h3>
<p>
This person records as many details as possible. Exactly what’s happening, with as much relevant
detail as the situation calls for. It could be what people are wearing. It could be what people
are saying. As much detail as possible, without interpretation.
</p>

<h3>Three: the Guardian</h3>
<p>
The guardian watches to make sure things are safe. They invite other people to stand witness.
They invite others to document. They invite others to act as guardians.
</p>

<p>
The guardian also keeps an eye on the victim or victims. Where possible, they offer calm,
grounding messages, such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep breathing.</li>
  <li>Help is on the way.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If possible, the guardian gathers the name or names of the victim(s), and relevant contact
information (family, friend, emergency contact).
</p>

<h3>Scaling</h3>
<p>
What this does is create a kind of accordion. It can expand or contract as needed.
</p>

<p>
If it’s just one person, that person needs to consciously hold all three roles:
guardianship, witnessing, and documentation. They need to take care of themselves and make sure
they are safe—and that others around them are safe, especially if others are in a state of shock
or rage.
</p>

<p>
But there will often be others who can join—people who understand what to do, especially if this
idea spreads.
</p>

<p><strong>It’s simple:</strong> One guardian. One witness. One journalist or archivist.</p>
