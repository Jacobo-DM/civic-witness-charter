<h1>Civic Witness Charter</h1>

<p><em>This document exists to preserve clarity under pressure.</em></p>

<p>
The Civic Witness Charter is not an argument, accusation, or campaign.
It does not seek attention, alignment, or escalation.
</p>

<p>
It is a boundary document — created so that testimony, observation, and
good-faith presence can be recorded without distortion, coercion, or
retaliatory framing.
</p>

<p>
The Charter is intended for moments where noise overwhelms evidence,
and where human beings require a shared reference point for restraint,
accountability, and dignity.
</p>

<p>
<strong>This repository is the canonical home of the Charter.</strong><br>
All mirrors, excerpts, or references must defer to the version held here.
</p>

<h2>Three Roles for Civic Witness</h2>

<p><strong>Ideally, you need three people.</strong></p>

<h3>Audio Integrity</h3>
<p>
When recording is underway, care should be taken to preserve the clarity of spoken audio.
Loud signals (such as whistles or shouted alerts), if used, should be deployed outside
the immediate recording area whenever possible, so that speech, names, commands,
and contextual sounds remain intelligible for later review or potential evidentiary use.
</p>

<h3>One: The Witness</h3>
<p>
The Witness gets as close as possible — safely — to record exactly what is going on.
Exactly as it is. No commentary.
</p>

<h3>Two: The Archivist / Journalist</h3>
<p>
This person records as many details as possible. Exactly what is happening, with as much
relevant detail as the situation calls for.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>What people are wearing</li>
  <li>What people are saying</li>
  <li>Timing, sequence, and context</li>
</ul>

<p>
As much detail as possible, without interpretation.
</p>

<h3>Three: The Guardian</h3>
<p>
The Guardian watches to make sure things are safe.
</p>

<p>
They invite others to stand witness, document, and act as additional guardians.
</p>

<p>
Where possible, the Guardian offers calm, grounding messages:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep breathing.</li>
  <li>Help is on the way.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If possible, the Guardian gathers the name(s) of the victim(s) and relevant contact information.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Accordion Principle</h2>

<p>
This creates a kind of accordion. It can expand or contract as needed.
</p>

<p>
If only one person is present, that person must consciously hold all three roles:
guardianship, witnessing, and documentation — while maintaining safety.
</p>

<p>
Others may join — especially as this protocol becomes understood.
</p>

<p><strong>It’s simple:</strong></p>
<p>
One Guardian.<br>
One Witness.<br>
One Journalist or Archivist.
