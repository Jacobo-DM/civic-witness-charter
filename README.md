# Civic Witness Charter

This document exists to preserve clarity under pressure.

The Civic Witness Charter is not an argument, accusation, or campaign.  
It does not seek attention, alignment, or escalation.

It is a boundary document — created so that testimony, observation, and  
good-faith presence can be recorded without distortion, coercion, or  
retaliatory framing.

The Charter is intended for moments where noise overwhelms evidence,  
and where human beings require a shared reference point for restraint,  
accountability, and dignity.

This repository is the canonical home of the Charter.  
All mirrors, excerpts, or references must defer to the version held here.

## Three Roles for Civic Witness

Ideally, you need three people.

### Audio Integrity
When recording is underway, care should be taken to preserve the clarity of spoken audio.  
Loud signals (such as whistles or shouted alerts), if used, should be deployed **outside the immediate recording area whenever possible**, so that speech, names, commands, and contextual sounds remain intelligible for later review or potential evidentiary use.

### One: The Witness
The Witness gets as close as possible — safely — to record exactly what is going on.  
Exactly as it is.  
No commentary.

### Two: The Archivist / Journalist
This person records as many details as possible. Exactly what is happening, with as much relevant detail as the situation calls for.

This may include:
- what people are wearing  
- what people are saying  
- timing, sequence, and context  

As much detail as possible, **without interpretation**.

### Three: The Guardian
The Guardian watches to make sure things are safe.

They invite other people to:
- stand witness  
- document  
- act as additional guardians  

The Guardian also keeps an eye on the victim or victims. Where possible, they offer calm, grounding messages, such as:
- Keep breathing.  
- Help is on the way.

If possible, the Guardian gathers:
- the name or names of the victim(s)  
- relevant contact information (family, friend, emergency contact)

## The Accordion Principle

What this creates is a kind of accordion.

It can expand or contract as needed.

If it is just one person, that person must consciously hold all three roles:
- guardianship  
- witnessing  
- documentation  

They must take care of themselves and ensure safety — their own and others’.

Especially when others are in a state of shock or rage.

But there will often be others who can join — people who understand what to do, especially as this idea spreads.

**It’s simple:**  
One Guardian.  
One Witness.  
One Journalist or Archivist.
