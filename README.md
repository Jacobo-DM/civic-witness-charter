# Civic Witness Charter

A simple, human-centered protocol for witnessing harm without escalating it.

The Civic Witness Charter defines three roles that can be held by individuals or groups in moments of civic distress, conflict, or harm:

- The Witness
- The Archivist / Journalist
- The Guardian

The goal is accuracy, safety, and continuity — not commentary, performance, or punishment.

This project is intentionally lightweight, portable, and adaptable.
